# First3DGraphicsEngine
A tangential learning experience. Credit to OneLoneCoder for the tutorial and inspiration. All code in this repo was coded alongside OneLoneCoder with the notable exception of the olcConsoleGameEngine.h file, which was provided by OneLoneCoder.

As an aside, I have always dreamed of creating a 3D game engine from scratch with a full toolset to create my own game that occurs in my minds eye. While this is a far cry from that dream, it is somehow quite validating to be able to make a simple cube rotate around, knowing that the math was manually entered by me. This is the first time I have ever seen matrix multiplication/division. Furthermore, it is the first time I have learned about the necessary maths required for rendering 3D objects on a 2D screen. A this point, this is undoubtedly the most difficult program I have written in C++, and one of the most technically difficult programs I have experienced in programming to date.

I have no idea how far this particular repo will go, and I have noticed that committing is impossible while the project is open (which is strange to me coming from a JS background), but I am excited to see what else I can learn here.
